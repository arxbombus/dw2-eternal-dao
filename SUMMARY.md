## Key Design Decisions

### Tone and Style

**✅ DO**:

- Accessible humor (works for non-xianxia fans)
- Bureaucratic comedy (immortals with paperwork)
- Low jargon (avoid technical terms)
- Character voice (distinct personalities)
- Sincere absurdity (take ridiculous seriously)

**❌ DON'T**:

- Heavy cultivation terminology
- Complex technobabble
- Overly serious tone
- Generic fantasy tropes
- Power level obsession

### Balance Philosophy

**Overpowered Baseline**: 30-80% stronger than standard races depending on game phase

**But Balanced Through**:

- Bureaucracy Load (limits rapid expansion)
- Karmic Debt (moral choices have consequences)
- Tribulation Weather (power attracts challenges)
- Meaningful choices (not all options are optimal)

**Target**: Player feels powerful but still makes interesting decisions

### Narrative Structure

**Player-Driven**: Story arcs trigger through gameplay, not time
**Branching**: Choices create different outcomes and unlock different content
**Replayability**: Multiple paths, random elements, episodic variety
**Integration**: Story reflects empire state (rapid expansion, tech progress, diplomacy)

## Technical Notes for Implementation

### GameEvents Structure

**Trigger Types to Use**:

- `Undefined` (time-based or manual)
- `Investigate` (ruins, abandoned ships)
- `Build` (facilities, stations)
- `ResearchBreakthrough` (tech completions)
- `EmpireRelationChange` (diplomatic events)

**Flag System**:

- Use event names as flags: `eternal_arc1_complete`
- Counters: `eternal_wanderer_clues` (need 3 for Arc 10)
- Choice tracking: `eternal_governance_infrastructure` vs `eternal_governance_harmony`

**Choice Implementation**:

- TriggerActionsAreChoices: true
- ChoiceButtonText for each option
- Separate follow-up events for each choice
- Set flags to track player decisions

### Balance Mechanisms

**Bureaucracy Load**:

- Hidden colony event or empire modifier
- Accumulates 1-5 points per action
- Decays 5 points/year
- Effects: +1-2% maintenance per point, caps at 100

**Karmic Debt**:

- Counter: -100 (credit) to +100 (debt)
- Thresholds: -50 (blessings), +30 (problems), +60 (Heaven's wrath)
- Affected by: wars, treaties, choices, racial features

**Tribulation Weather**:

- Chance: 2% base + 0.5%/10 colonies + 1%/50 ships
- Can harvest for energy (Feature 3)
- Reduced by: Karmic Credit, Heaven-appeasing actions, Risk facilities

## Known Design Challenges

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Balancing OP with Fun**: Race is intentionally strong—keep player engaged through choices and humor, not difficulty

2. **Bureaucracy Load Tracking**: Need reliable hidden counter system—test thoroughly

3. **Event Frequency**: Episodic events need proper cooldowns—too frequent = annoying, too rare = forgettable

4. **AI Behavior**: AI must handle unique mechanics (Edicts, tribulation harvesting)—may need custom scripts

5. **Branching Complexity**: 10 arcs with 2-3 choices each = many possible states—flag system must be robust

6. **Power Creep**: Late game could become trivial—Arc 10 choices should matter even at victory threshold

### Testing Focus Areas

- Early game expansion rate (too fast = broken)
- Bureaucracy Load accumulation (too high = frustrating)
- Karmic Debt swing speed (too volatile = random)
- Tribulation frequency (too often = annoying)
- Story arc pacing (too slow = boring, too fast = overwhelming)
- Component balance (too strong = no challenge)
- AI competence (too weak = boring opponent)

---

## Future Expansion Ideas

### Potential DLC/Updates

1. **Other Scattering Factions**:

   - Traditionalists (Dao-primary faction)
   - Innovators (Tech-primary faction)
   - Hospitality Faction (dumpling supremacy)

2. **The Wanderer's Return**:

   - New story arc chain
   - Reality-altering choices
   - Universe creation mechanics

3. **Expanded Senate**:

   - More committees with unique mechanics
   - Inter-House political intrigue
   - Senate election/reform system

4. **Cultivation Mechanics**:

   - Leader cultivation progression
   - Tribulation breakthrough events
   - Sect specialization system

5. **Multiverse Expansion**:
   - Portal to home universe
   - Dimensional exploration
   - Cross-reality diplomacy
